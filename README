File::Flock is a wrapper around the flock() call.  The only thing it
does that is special is that it creates the lock file if the lock file
does not already exist.

It will also try to remove the lock file.  This makes it a bit 
complicated.

To install File::Flock use the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make 
	make test
	make install

Under perl5.002, the make test will emit some warnings about "9" and
"99" not being numeric values.  I believe this is a bug in perl.
