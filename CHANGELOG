Fixed the object-style interface.  

Attempt to fix a double-unlock bug that makes the Linux port unhappy

Chaged O_RDONLY to O_RDWR for all file opens because Solaris won't let
you get an exclusive lock on a read-only file.  Crazy!  Change suggested
by Lupe Christoph <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de>.  Thanks!

Rewrote the handling of the removal of files created just so that
they could be locked.  Also tried to make sure that now file descriptors
could get leaked.
